# Covid19-analysis-using-Tableau

In this analysis conducted using Tableau, I've visualized and interpreted COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights. Through interactive graphs, maps, and charts, I've showcased the progression of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time. Additionally, I've mapped the geographic distribution of cases, highlighting hotspots and regional variations. The analysis delves into demographic impacts, displaying how the virus affects different age groups and genders. Vaccination progress is also tracked, illustrating the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated. This Tableau-based analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's evolution and its impact on various aspects, aiding informed decision-making.
